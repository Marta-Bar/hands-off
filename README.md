# hands-off

Following O'Reilly's book "Hands-on Machine Learning" I work with some datasets and improve them with more feature engeneering and ML techniques.


1) The Housing folder is devoted to the study of the California Housing dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/camnugent/california-housing-prices). This involves supervised regression models, after an analysis and visualization of the data. My final version can be found in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/martaba/california-housing-comments-welcome/notebook
2) The second task deals with on image recognition: the MNIST dataset. Work in progress..
